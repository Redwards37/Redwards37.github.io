    <h2>BMC History</h2>
    <p>
      The Black Men Coalition (BMC) was founded in 2021 at Southern Illinois University by Iyanuoluwa Alabi, Dennis Sturkey, Demetrius Lovejoy, and faculty advisor Paul Fraizer. 
      Although the organization was established that year, it did not officially become active until the fall of 2023 due to a lack of initial membership.

      To build momentum and establish a strong presence on campus, BMC welcomed incoming freshmen onto its first executive board. These pioneering members included Jakyi Humphrey,
      Kamron Singleton, Mathew Echols, Dashawn Brown, Derrick Gardener, Joshua Gardner, and Rae Edwards. These young leaders brought fresh energy, vision, and commitment to the 
      organization, helping to lay the foundation for what would become a powerful community for Black men on campus.

      Together, they organized events, led outreach efforts, and created a safe space for empowerment, mentorship, and unity. Their goal was not only to support each other
      academically and socially but also to uplift the wider SIU community through service, leadership, and cultural engagement. With this strong foundation, BMC continues to grow, even winning Most Active RSO on campus in 2024,
      shaping the next generation of Black leaders and creating a legacy of excellence, brotherhood, and resilience.
